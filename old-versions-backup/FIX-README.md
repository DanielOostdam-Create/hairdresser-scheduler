# 🚀 Hairdresser Scheduler - FIXED VERSION

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The original system had several issues that prevented it from finding available appointments:

### **1. Wrong HTML Parsing** ❌→✅
- **Problem**: The original parser looked for generic patterns like `data-date="2025-08-01"` 
- **Solution**: Updated to parse Dutch Calendly interface with patterns like `aria-label="Friday, August 1 - beschikbare tijden"`

### **2. Single Page Fetching** ❌→✅  
- **Problem**: Only fetched the main Calendly page, missing month-specific availability
- **Solution**: Added multi-month checking that fetches calendar data for current month + 2-3 future months

### **3. Inadequate Error Handling** ❌→✅
- **Problem**: No visibility into what HTML was actually being fetched
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive diagnostics and logging

### **4. No Dutch Language Support** ❌→✅
- **Problem**: Didn't recognize Dutch text like "beschikbare tijden" (available times)
- **Solution**: Added support for both English and Dutch month names and text patterns

## 🎯 Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hairdresser-scheduler-fixed.js` | **Main fixed scheduler** with all improvements |
| `test-fixed-system.js` | Test script to verify the fixes work |
| `debug-html.js` | Debug script to see actual HTML from Calendly |
| `install-fix.js` | Script to safely replace original with fixed version |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Test the Fixed Version First (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/danieloostdam/Desktop/hairdresser-scheduler

# Test the new parsing logic
node test-fixed-system.js

# Check what HTML we're getting from Calendly  
node debug-html.js

# Test availability check with fixed version
node hairdresser-scheduler-fixed.js check

# Find earliest available appointment
node hairdresser-scheduler-fixed.js earliest
```

### Option 2: Install the Fix (Replaces Original)
```bash
# This will backup your original and install the fix
node install-fix.js

# Then use the normal commands
node hairdresser-scheduler.js check
node hairdresser-scheduler.js start
```

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

If you're still not seeing appointments, run these in order:

### 1. Check HTML Content
```bash
node debug-html.js
```
**Look for**: 
- Does it contain "beschikbare tijden"?
- Are there aria-label attributes?
- Does the HTML look like a calendar page?

### 2. Test Parsing Logic
```bash
node test-fixed-system.js
```
**Look for**:
- Does the sample parsing work?
- Are dates being found in the real HTML?

### 3. Test Multi-Month Checking
```bash
node hairdresser-scheduler-fixed.js earliest
```
**Look for**:
- Are multiple months being checked?
- Are any dates found in any month?

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### New Parsing Function
```javascript
// OLD (didn't work with Calendly)
/data-date="(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2})"/g

// NEW (works with Dutch Calendly)
/aria-label="([^"]*) - beschikbare tijden"/g
// Parses: "Friday, August 1 - beschikbare tijden" → "2025-08-01"
```

### Multi-Month Checking
```javascript
// OLD: Only checked main page
const html = await this.fetchCalendlyPage();

// NEW: Checks multiple months
const dates = await this.checkMultipleMonths(3);
// Checks current month + 2 future months
```

### Better Error Handling
- Shows exactly what HTML is being fetched
- Diagnostic information about page content
- Clear error messages when parsing fails

## 📊 Expected Results

When working correctly, you should see:

```
🗓️ Checking 3 months for availability...
📅 Checking 2025-05...
✅ 2025-05: Found 0 available dates  
📅 Checking 2025-06...
❌ 2025-06: No available dates found
📅 Checking 2025-07...
✅ 2025-07: Found 2 available dates
📅 Checking 2025-08...
✅ 2025-08: Found 15 available dates

🎯 COMPREHENSIVE RESULTS:
Total unique available dates: 17
📋 All dates: 2025-07-11, 2025-07-14, 2025-08-01, 2025-08-05, ...

🎯 Target week (2025-07-07 to 2025-07-13):
🎉 TARGET WEEK AVAILABLE! Found 1 appointment(s): 2025-07-11
```

## 🛠️ If It Still Doesn't Work

### Common Issues:

1. **Calendly Changed HTML Structure**
   - Run `node debug-html.js` and look for the actual patterns
   - Update the parsing regex in `parseAvailableDates()` function

2. **Different Language/Locale**
   - Check if Calendly is showing in English vs Dutch
   - Update month name mapping if needed

3. **Bot Detection**
   - Calendly might be blocking automated requests
   - Try different User-Agent strings or add delays

4. **URL Changed**
   - Verify https://calendly.com/kapper_eric/30min still works in browser
   - Update URL in constructor if needed

## 🔄 Reverting Changes

If you need to go back to the original:
```bash
# If you used install-fix.js
cp hairdresser-scheduler-original-backup.js hairdresser-scheduler.js

# Or just use the fixed version directly
node hairdresser-scheduler-fixed.js [command]
```

## 💡 Next Steps

1. **Test first**: Run `node test-fixed-system.js`
2. **Check HTML**: Run `node debug-html.js` 
3. **Verify parsing**: Look for "beschikbare tijden" in output
4. **Install fix**: Run `node install-fix.js` when satisfied
5. **Start monitoring**: Run `node hairdresser-scheduler.js start`

The fix addresses all the major issues identified in your debugging process. The system should now correctly find available appointments in your target week (July 7-13, 2025) when they become available!
