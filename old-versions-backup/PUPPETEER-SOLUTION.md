# 🚀 Puppeteer-Based Hairdresser Scheduler - LIVE DATA SOLUTION

## 🎯 **THE REAL SOLUTION**: Browser Automation

This version uses **Puppeteer** (headless Chrome) to get **LIVE, REAL-TIME** calendar data from Calendly by actually rendering the JavaScript - just like a real browser.

### ✅ **What This Solves:**
- **Gets actual live data** from Calendly (not static HTML)
- **Handles JavaScript-loaded content** automatically
- **Works with dynamic calendar updates** 
- **Accurate real-time availability detection**
- **No more "no dates found" issues**

---

## 🛠️ **Quick Setup (2 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Install Puppeteer**
```bash
cd /Users/danieloostdam/Desktop/hairdresser-scheduler

# Option A: Auto-install (recommended)
node puppeteer-scheduler.js install

# Option B: Manual install
npm install puppeteer
```

### **Step 2: Test the System** 
```bash
# Test with live Calendly data (takes 30-60 seconds)
node test-puppeteer.js
```

### **Step 3: Start Monitoring**
```bash
# Start hourly monitoring with live data
node puppeteer-scheduler.js start
```

## 📋 **All Commands**

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `node puppeteer-scheduler.js install` | Install Puppeteer | One-time setup |

## 🔍 **How It Works**

1. **Launches headless Chrome** browser
2. **Navigates to Calendly** page with proper headers
3. **Waits for JavaScript** to render calendar
4. **Extracts live data** from rendered DOM
5. **Parses Dutch date formats** correctly
6. **Checks target week** (July 7-13, 2025) 
7. **Sends notifications** when available

### **Technical Details:**
- **Browser**: Headless Chrome via Puppeteer
- **Wait Strategy**: Wait for `[data-testid="calendar"]` + 3s buffer
- **Date Pattern**: `aria-label="Friday, August 1 - beschikbare tijden"`
- **Multi-Month**: Checks current + 2 future months
- **Target Week**: Monday to Sunday containing July 11, 2025
