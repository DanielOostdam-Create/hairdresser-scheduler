# Hairdresser Scheduler - Fixed Version

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Fixed

### 1. **Connection Issues (Protocol error: Connection closed)**
- **Problem**: Browser connections were being reused and timing out
- **Solution**: 
  - Always create fresh browser instance for each scraping session
  - Close browser immediately after getting data
  - Added proper cleanup in error handlers
  - Use `headless: 'new'` instead of `headless: true`

### 2. **Browser Stability**
- Added more Chrome flags to prevent crashes:
  - `--no-zygote`
  - `--disable-background-timer-throttling`
  - `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows`
  - `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`

### 3. **Error Recovery**
- Implemented retry logic with progressive delays
- Browser cleanup on every error
- Consecutive error tracking
- Network connectivity checks before sending emails

### 4. **Memory Management**
- Close pages immediately after data extraction
- Proper browser disposal after each operation
- No persistent browser connections
